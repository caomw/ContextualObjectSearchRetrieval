A multi-camera object search and retrieval algorithm using matlab.

This is a matlab implementation of the papers "Context-Aware Hypergraph Modeling for Re-identification and Summarization" submitted to TMM and "Context-Aware Graph Modeling for Object Search and Retrieval in a Wide Area Camera Network" published in ICDSC'13.

Usage
------------

In order to run the algorithm, use the following command:

i) 

ii) 

iii) Finally run main.m

Data Processing
------------

i)


Dataset
------------
i) Download the sample dataset archive in a supported format from: and save it in the root folder

ii) Untar the data folder:
tar -xzf data.tar.gz

iii) The folder structure would like this:

~~~
.
├── README.md
├── data
├── data.tar.gz
├── libs
└── src
